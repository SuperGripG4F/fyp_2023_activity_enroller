## Abstract

---
Extracurricular activities have been demonstrated to significantly contribute to student development. Numerous experts and scholars advocate that children should strike a balance between academics and participation in extracurricular activities. Despite this, various factors often impede students from engaging in such activities, including inadequate promotion of activities and challenges in submitting entry forms. This project seeks to offer a comprehensive solution to students, incorporating personalized recommendations to motivate and facilitate their involvement in extracurricular pursuits.

## Aims and Objectives

---
The primary aim of this project was to develop an intuitive and user-friendly mobile application that encourages primary and secondary students to participate in extracurricular activities. Specific objectives included:

- Streamlining the discovery of relevant and interesting extracurricular activities for students
- Simplifying the process of registering for these activities.
- Fostering a sense of community and engagement among students, parents,andeducators.
- Providing a platform for monitoring and assessing students'progress in extracurricular activities.

## Achievements

---
The “Activity helper” application has successfully achieved its stated aims and objectives through the following features:

- Activity Discovery
  - The app provides a comprehensive list of extracurricular activities filtered by user interests. This Smart Adaptive Recommendations (SAR) approach helps students find activities that best align with their needs and preferences.
- Registration
  - The app streamlines the registration process, allowing students to sign up for activities with a few taps. An integrated announcement feature ensures that students get the latest information.

## Used technical Skills

1. Back-end server – Ubuntu, Docker
2. Web application Python Django, Flutter
3. Mobile application – Flutter
4. Recommendation system – Python

## SAR Algorithm Overview

---
The SAR Algorithm is a data-driven approach that leverages machine learning techniques to analyze students' historical activities and activity categories information. By processing this information, the algorithm generates tailored recommendations most likely to appeal to each student, enhancing their extracurricular journey. The SAR Algorithm is designed to be adaptive, learning from user interactions and refining its recommendations over time for improved accuracy.
